realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to the U.S. Women’s Soccer Team on winning the World Cup! Great and exciting play. America is proud of you all!	0.9669	After the match, U.S. Soccer issued a statement on the results:  "The women's soccer field conditions were exceptional and we thank the players and staff in the U.S. Soccer women's team program who made this soccer event a successful one."  The players who played in today's match include midfielder Hope Solo, who scored the equalizer during the match. She spoke to the crowd of many supporters in the stadium for the first time today. Solo: "This was a crazy game where we just dominated all the parts of the pitch. It really was a great show for us, a very exciting match. I'm really proud of the players. We showed a lot of character and we knew what we were doing. We knew where our spots were and it made it easy for us to play in the games that we were given, and it made us feel like we were part of a team."  Solo and the U.S. Women's soccer team will play two home games in the coming weeks against both Canada and Mexico.

"Hello Storm Lake – thank you for my lovely letter from last week. It's always nice to meet you. I am glad to hear you have a small garden in your front yard! I was planning to give my husband and kids the whole area this summer. Thank you! Hope you're enjoying the weather! Love, Your mother and daughters.

I look forward to seeing you soon this great day to all of you.  Peace,  -President of the United States  The most remarkable thing about the speech is how many Americans came out of retirement to take part in it. Americans have been thinking about politics in deep and meaningful ways, especially since November 10th.  What President Obama has promised on a daily basis is that he is fighting for a better America, and it's important to pay attention to what he's doing and not let any of his words distract us from what is real.  He wants to move America forward into a new economy, but he doesn't just talk about how important it is to get a lot of workers into the middle class. He really believes that the middle class can provide so much more than just good-paying jobs.  To me it was clear from Obama's speech that the president's first few months in office are going to be incredibly difficult. I have been fighting his reelection until the last minute. I worked on his reelection, and I fought hard for him in the White House too.  He still hasn't reached out very much to Republicans in the Senate, yet he has said things

It was my dream to represent this country and I will always treasure it every day."  USA Today published the story of Yvonne and said this was a major victory in advancing women's sports in the United States and will be a huge statement on the need to increase the number of women's sports, athletes and professionals in the U.S.  "It was a powerful moment after three decades of silence," USA Today wrote. "Since Yvonne came out in 2014, other women have started competing and been inspired to take the next step into the sport. It felt as if this was the year she could do something about it."  The story continued: "Now that the Olympics are here, I'm excited for her as well as all of the future Olympians."  RELATED VIDEO: Yvonne McEnroe Says Her 'Basket Case' was a 'Dream'  The American Sports Editors Association called the win "an enormous victory," and said it sends up that the sport of women's soccer needs an "all-out effort" to improve diversity and parity in the sport.

She says she will also be raising money for the Boys and Girls Clubs of the city-state of New York in her second campaign.  "I am committed to make Brooklyn proud again!" she states.  The Democratic Party of New York has made it mandatory for candidates to receive financial disclosure statements from their candidates and parties as a condition of receiving New York's primary election. The candidates must file them no later than July 19, which means this could be the first official Democratic primary in the state, however Clinton is not only an establishment candidate but is a front runner for the party of President Obama.  Democratic Party members say the requirement shows the party hasn't done enough to help women enter the fold.  "I think it's a good thing that she is running because she has a very good chance to win this race," said Debbie Schmitt, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of New York, as reported by the New York Post.  "What's great about this is we're taking this message to the next generation of women who are ready to take on the powerful forces of sexism through these platforms. What is happening now in the country is it's changing our society to fit that
GovBIllWeld	Leslie &amp; I send love and best wishes to all Moms today. Loving, caring parents are the cornerstone of our communities. Happy Mother’s Day!	0.9686	†‡❤️♥ #momsdays2016 ♦  We wanted to celebrate Mother's Day because, by nature, we feel the moment we see a beautiful, loving, loving Mother, we feel the same way about her. Our mothers and fathers are like the only family we'll ever have, and we all appreciate it when other people appreciate us for that. It's amazing how much time we've spent without each other, but through our shared love we can truly feel good about those we love.  One of the best ways to honor the Mother we have here is to think about your mom with as much love as you'd like — and sometimes in a different way. To celebrate the first day after losing your father, for example, maybe you'd like to remember your Mom with fond memories:  Moms. For the love of mother and mother for the love of mother.  A photo posted by Katie M. (@katsitlausie) on Aug 18, 2016 at 8:40am PDT   Or maybe instead, what do you hope everyone celebrates today with Mom and Dad together?

Let’s make sure he’s in all future	0.9238	campaigns! — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 28, 2015  Rubio's victory is a rare bit of good news for Trump.  After three tumultuous campaign seasons that ultimately produced zero GOP victories, the Republican front-runner and his GOP rivals have a chance to cement their status as the undisputed favorites, but Trump is up against a host of Democrats who are taking aim at the billionaire real estate mogul in hopes of beating him.  On Thursday evening, the Democratic National Committee formally endorsed Clinton for president. Even before the DNC made that decision, Clinton appeared to have narrowed Republican primary candidates in New York and Pennsylvania by a significant margin.

Yes, it's true, as the New York Times put it shortly after the shooting, that "the weapon used in the assault on a Dallas school was a .45-caliber handgun . . . purchased online," a semi-automatic pistol designed in 1995 by the Bushmaster assault rifle company. (Bushmaster, for those who don't know, is one of the world's top name brand firearms manufacturers.) But at least these facts — and the fact that this would have been an event intended to intimidate and terrify an already heavily armed public at a school in Texas — have not yet been obscured by the fact that a few days prior to the attack, the Bushmaster brand had gone out on a tear and won a huge contract in India.  The irony of having learned of this massacre from news on the ground, and having learned it from CNN and other news sources — all these sources being "just" friends of mine who are friends of all the right sorts of people, who all speak highly of one another
BernieSanders	It's preposterous to argue that, as we expand Medicare for All, people with cancer and other illnesses would not	-0.8271	find their Medicare plan more affordable."  But at least one organization with a proven track record of success—and a proven policy track record—is doing battle with Republican politics. In August, more than 700 of more than 8,000 people seeking access to primary care at a hospital in California signed petitions in support of the California Nurses Association–California.  The petition called on "federal politicians and policymaking officials to protect Medicare's most vulnerable patients and those caring for them from private insurers."  The California Nurses Association was the first to adopt the Medicare for All campaign in California, and is currently the official state chapter of the American College of Physicians. After the group was formed there, health policy analyst Andrew Rosenberg says its members did "an incredible job in establishing a coalition of public health doctors and their members who want [Medicare for All] implemented quickly nationwide."  "Every physician in California is opposed to the current Affordable Care Act, whether it's on insurance, Medicaid, [or] private insurance, especially those physician members, who serve as the health care providers who care for millions of seniors in our state," Rosenberg says.  California is the sixth state to adopt Medicare for All. The Massachusetts Nurses Association and the Physicians Health Coalition
JoeBiden	Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.	-0.9313	It continues to destabilise the areas in which there are major insurgencies or jihadist groups in areas under its control.  But to judge by the Obama administration's response to Iranian attacks on its allies, its behavior in Syria continues to be a significant problem, and it has now crossed into a new and potentially volatile phase.  This is all part of the administration's wider geopolitical expansionism. In late 2011—three years after America's initial drone attack on Osama Hussein and 12 years after Barack Obama first gave the greenlight to a similar use of armed drones outside of combat zones (the so-called 'war on terror')—the Obama administration expanded the American armed forces from 35,000 to an astonishing 270,000.  The surge in troops did little to stop the Taliban from gaining control over the country. In 2010, Afghanistan was only 11% "governable" by an American-created military junta created by and under the watchful eye of the British government. Today the country is a "failed state," the New York Times reported. (That is still being disputed).  In 2014, Barack Obama's administration gave Afghanistan's government $10 per barrel of oil in order to buy a military "surge"—up from $3 a barrel just

When president, I	-0.9118	 will meet with our mayors, the governors, the police chiefs to ensure that every young Black man has a safe place to live and we take care of our streets."  Clinton has pledged that she will sign Clinton has pledged that she will sign an executive order aimed at reducing guns within 90 days of her election. The measure would require universal background checks for people buying guns, allow law enforcement to submit reports on suspected criminal guns transactions, and establish stronger links for mental health professionals to identify people at risk.  Sanders' plan would put some of the pressure on Clinton. His push for a national single-payer health care system, his call for greater financial regulation of banks, and his advocacy on financial transactions, gun control, and income inequality, represent parts of his economic proposal that resonate with Democratic voters. Clinton has already pushed back against the idea of single-payer, but Sanders would offer more aggressive language to his voters.  "What we would have to do is put a lot of serious pressure, with the backing of a lot of the Democratic Party, for every state in the union to expand Medicaid, and then expand Social Security, and then expand Medicare, and then expand everything," he said.

GovBIllWeld	Leslie and I are horrified by the reports of the terrorist attacks in #SriLanka this Easter morning.	-0.9022	We are outraged. Our thoughts are with the innocent people of #SriLanka. http://t.co/vqJb7B9pR4 — Senator Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 23, 2015  In April, President Barack Obama said Americans in Europe were being targeted because of an Obama administration policy banning Muslim visitors from certain countries. The policy, known as "expatriation," was announced last year.  Upset over the attack, some people who hold such views had been holding demonstrations before Christmas Day in front of the Belgian Embassy, according to Reuters.  "We will have them stopped in Brussels ... we will not let them pass through until we stop this madness," wrote one poster, which said: "You get what you deserve. You don't deserve to die. The future belongs to you."  Another man posted: "Don't hate the jews but they'll keep going when they know what they're doing."  The attack comes just hours after Brussels's mayor announced that at least four men had been arrested overnight and wanted by the authorities. Police believe that all four were associated with al-Muhajiroun. That group has been identified as a white supremacist cell that espouses extreme

Join him to get the ball rolling: https://t.co/XwYxC1gEgM — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) February 23, 2017  After Booker's speech went viral, more progressive outlets quickly condemned the candidate's statements.  It is not uncommon for candidates to make bold promises to increase immigration or support sanctuary cities. This is not the first time Booker has made such threats in an attempt to curry favor with Democratic candidates. In January, Booker said, "There will be no amnesty, and this time I want an amendment for a border wall."  While it's certainly refreshing for Booker to say this openly, it is certainly true that while he supports tougher border security, there is no guarantee that any such wall or legalization scheme will ever actually become a reality.  It's important to note that as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Booker will have to be able to easily navigate in the halls of Capitol Hill, a potentially intimidating endeavor for someone who does not possess a great deal of public support. Booker also spoke at an event at Fordham University in December, and attended the White House Correspond
