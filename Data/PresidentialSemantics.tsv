Trump	Donald Trump	Text	Hillary Clinton has put American lives at risk.' (Pete Marovich/AP) Trump gave reporters the same response as his fellow Republicans after an attack at a San Bernardino cafe Thursday: "Hillary Clinton has put American lives at risk." The attack in California, where a radicalized man killed 14 people in June in an attack on a crowded holiday party, and Trump's apparent embrace of his political opponents has alarmed some in Congress and within his own party who may be willing to try to force Trump into a more traditional presidential platform. "I wish Hillary Clinton were elected president," Trump said Thursday in a private room in his office with his wives, Melania and Barron. "She is one term worse than a disgrace to the memory of the United States." Trump's remarks came a day after several of his closest friends and family members, including some of Trump's former competitors in recent GOP primary contests, had released messages attacking Hillary Clinton and warning the GOP's nominee against making political comments. Clinton has faced sharp criticism in recent weeks, particularly for her use of a private email server as secretary of state to send and receive top secret diplomatic and military decisions. She has largely avoided attacks during her two months as the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, making her the first woman president at a time when female leaders on both the presidential and legislative levels
Trump	Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current president of the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personal	Wikipedia	secretary for John F. Kennedy. An accomplished athlete and a lifelong friend of John F. Kennedy, Trump became a household name as he was a candidate for president of the United States in 1968. As a businessman and entertainer, Trump has made a name for himself in the arts, entertainment, sports, fashion, and life. He became an elected official representing his district, and after winning the U.S. Senate election, he served as President George W. Bush's second in command. He was nominated for President by President George H.W. Bush in 2008 along with fellow Republican and Democratic Party nominees John McCain and Joe Lieberman. During his 2008 run for the White House, Trump won the Iowa caucuses, a landslide win that greatly boosted his popularity and put him into power. He defeated Democrat Barack Obama in the general election in November 2008 Throughout his campaign, Trump made a point of condemning Republican establishment members and former party leaders for their support of Republican candidates and policies. When he was attacked for the Republican Party unity in the 2008 Iowa Republican Presidential caucus, Trump said that he believed John McCain and Mitt Romney would have been better for the country. This statement drew widespread criticism from both Democrats and Republicans alike. After coming within two

Trump	President Donald Trump left the White House Saturday for a last-minute trip to Camp David -- escaping Washington at a moment when sources say he appears increasingly disenchanted by advice from his inner circle and out of sorts with some of the mainstays in his Cabinet.	CNN	Meanwhile, Trump's wife, Melania Trump, began to take time off to celebrate the birth of their daughter, Tiffany ― the couple had been slated to attend the annual Miss Universe pageant, which is being held in Hungary. A day later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer issued an abrupt correction to a reporter's question about whether Trump's trip was more than just an escape. "They're doing it out of patriotism ... and they're going to the White House, the Cabinet was briefed on it, and as you know all Presidents are invited on a trip. And obviously the President's going to take them to Camp David."  And on Saturday, as reporters took a break from the tour-traffic-packed Oval Office to take photos with the couple as they entered the White House from the West Front, Trump appeared to take a moment to congratulate his wife. "Congratulations on being a mom, and a dad," he told Melania at the Pentagon's Visitor Center. "That girl is the beauty of the United States of America."
Trump	With my father’s official unveiling of his re-election campaign Tuesday evening, Americans are about to witness another 17-month mudslinging slog to determine the future course of the nation.	FoxNews	To begin the campaign, we turn from the presidency to candidates for Congress.   A few weeks ago, when I was the mayor of Salt Lake City, I took on the Salt Lake City Democratic Party. My first order of business after I became mayor was to find out where they went to church. I found out they went to Utah Valley Church. They went to an evangelical evangelical church. They went to a church founded by the Reverend Billy Graham. They went to something called The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  Advertisement  My second challenge was to find out whether you could take that church's doctrine, its leaders, its teachings and put them into concrete policy. I made sure to find out who they worshiped. They worshiped God, but the church was not, as Mormons believe, a temple. It was an assembly room, and what they worshiped at that place, which was also called the First Presidency and First Quorum of the Seventy, they were not supposed to speak in the presence of the presiding officers of a public building. I had people put their hats on.  So for a while, I thought I had it figured
Trump	US President Donald Trump has formally launched his re-election campaign, urging supporters to "keep this team in place" for four more years.	bbc	(The Washington Post)  When Barack Obama was preparing to leave office, he told friends and allies he would make history as the first American president to win a landslide re-election in a presidential election. When he walked away with his second term, he warned that Democrats, who had done so much to reverse Republican gains, risked being "frozen out," a threat that seems to have come true.  He didn't always use it. With the 2016 election looming and Republicans losing all their seats in several of their statehouses — an outcome that could force the country to turn to the legislative and executive branch, Democrats had already begun to lose control of both houses. But Obama's victory in 2016 meant there was no stopping him from pushing forward — and it didn't stop Republicans, either. It also meant the country was headed to a new normal, one where Republicans were expected to govern, not dictate, America's politics. The country faced its most dangerous situation since the 1920s, one that the nation's oldest party and the biggest political organization today had largely ignored.  Weeks before the November election, Obama was in charge of the first new White House post he has ever held after serving as an eight-year congressman. For the better

Sanders has faced the same complaints about his political integrity since he first began raising money in 1996.  "This kind of pattern of abuse just continues to show how little regard the Sanders campaign really takes his supporters, so it is only logical for them to begin thinking of someone else to endorse for president," said Democratic strategist Jon Cohen, who has worked in both parties. "This is yet another reason to support Sanders in June, as he can't afford to leave the Democratic primaries."  If Sanders does drop out, he would join a growing list of other presidential candidates who aren't sure when or how they'll drop out of the race to the left of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Some, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (who announced his bid after the primaries wrapped up) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, are not ruling out running into trouble in the general election, as Sen. Rand Paul did earlier this month.  That's also the same logic Sanders supporters believe was behind his decision to enter the race in the first place. Sanders, who is a self-described "democratic socialist," is campaigning on his plan to create an all-volunteer military to fight the influence of overseas and Middle Eastern extremists within NATO in the midst of a war
Sanders	Bernard Sanders (born September 8, 1941) is an American politician who has served as the junior United States Senator from Vermont since 2007. 	Wikipedia	He was elected Vermont's First Congressional District Senator in 2006 for a second term, and then elected to a second term in November 2014. From 2007 to 2013, Sanders served in Congress, and he has been an independent candidate for President in the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination contest. Senator Sanders is a democratic socialist. His views are based around supporting issues of economic equality, public education and healthcare, environmental protection, and racial justice. Many of his policy statements include support for Medicare for all, expanding Social Security, creating a public works program to build affordable housing, increasing the minimum wage, raising the minimum wage and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Senator Sanders is a member of the United States Senate from Vermont. He voted for and opposed measures that would increase U.S. trade policy in the WTO, and supports ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He co-sponsored legislation called "The Fair Pay for Fair Work Act". He supports policies to strengthen America's social safety net and has pushed for federal investments in jobs training and training programs to help Americans transition out of poverty. He has also been a staunch protector of workers' rights and fought to keep millions of the most vulnerable in the workforce from being

"I believe in working together as a nation to achieve that fundamental transformation." This was Sanders' second appearance as head of the party. In March, the Vermont senator announced his candidacy for president.   "The future of our politics depends on the strength of the economy. We can't afford a broken politics," Sanders said. "The Democratic Party is the only party in terms of wealth and income in the country that has balanced the budget and raised wages of nearly every worker by far since World War II." He added: "That is the reason why, despite the rise of huge wealth and income inequality in this country, we are the only major modern economic power."   "I have fought to guarantee that no two families in our country will ever be locked into poverty and that no president in our country should impose an income tax on the hopes and dreams of working families." On climate change, Sanders said that, "there simply cannot be any question but that the present-day crisis is a grave one and is caused not only by climate change but by the greed and irresponsibility of
Sanders	Sen. Bernie Sanders is set to stake out uncharted territory in the Democratic presidential primary, offering up a plan to completely eliminate the student loan debt of every American.	CNN	Sanders recently offered his plan in a speech to students and faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign after which he met with students from the College of St. Benedict, where the professor has been an active fixture of the student activism movement for most of his adult life.  In the hour-long speech, Sanders explained his plans to completely reduce student loan debt. It's likely the student debt of the current crop of students will be eliminated by a simple mathematical formula.  "Imagine you're paying a quarter of a million dollars a year for a bachelor's degree. Let's also assume the average student makes $30,000 a year. Let's say you buy a house or get married. You have $100,000 to work with. In five years, you will pay off every student debt you have in student loans and save all the money you paid off to get a college degree," said Sanders. "One third of the student loan debt today is for student loans today — all of this will be gone in five years by having my plan happen."  The speech was delivered on the campus auditorium at UIC and was delivered to a small crowd of about 15 people.
Sanders	In America today, we have more wealth and income inequality than any other major country on Earth and it is worse now than at any other time since the 1920s.	FoxNews	The gap between the rich and everyone else is widening. While this problem was supposed to worsen when the middle class grew richer, we have actually seen the rich gain more than ever, while ordinary people have lost ground, often severely, to the super-rich. We are on the verge of another huge financial crisis if these trends persist.  Yet the political leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties have not done anything to address this. In fact, most Democratic politicians, and almost all of them, are worse than ever about addressing income inequality.  For example, as Wall Street and Wall Street-type politicians continue to benefit from "too big to fail" banks, the amount of wealth created and owned by the richest 1% of Americans has continued to grow. For decades, we have focused on inequality, but our efforts to create jobs and to provide services like social welfare and affordable prescription drugs failed to move the money-power machine they've created. As a result, there hasn't been any progress toward the middle class. The only people who see that are those with wealth at the top, those who see how easily those at the top are able to move wealth into and from their pockets, and those like the super-rich who
Sanders	In 2016 Bernie Sanders arrived on the Democratic presidential scene with all the surprise of a thunderclap in a blue sky.	bbc	His campaign launched with a slick advertising campaign that played on Hillary Clinton's weaknesses. He attacked Sanders on Wall Street — even though Clinton had no personal ties to the financial industry or the investment banks. He criticized her for her lack of knowledge on economic issues — even though she had over five years in the Senate to know the real issues — and even though she had won the endorsement of the labor movement.  He built an unlikely coalition of progressive-leaning and liberal candidates — particularly from the left, from the Democratic Party establishment and from across the political spectrum.  On the campaign trail, Sanders took on Hillary Clinton's record as secretary of state and for a long period, he ran a very positive and inspiring public image of her. He also turned his strong attack on "the establishment" away from Clinton and towards Trump: He said that "one of the things that is failing America is not only Donald Trump, but the entire political establishment."  It was an extraordinary political feat. But it was also an amazing political misadventure, one that had little to do with Sanders. It's one of the reasons why this isn't even a presidential primary anymore.  The two candidates and many of Bernie Sanders voters now blame him as "the nominee," not
Weld	Bill Weld	Text	Bill Weld has a plan to change the state's marijuana laws so that they are based on scientific research and safe alternatives," the former Republican governor said in a statement. "We will take real action to provide patients with the treatment they need by setting aside a year from July 1 to study the safety and efficacy of cannabidiol oil for medical abuse. We can also do better by focusing on proven strategies to reduce marijuana-related deaths and reduce other harms and harms, by providing additional help to parents with families impacted by the war on drugs and by ensuring that all patients have access to the appropriate forms of treatment."  At this stage, there are few concrete plans to achieve that goal but Weld said he'll continue to pursue them.  "For too long, the policy decisions of this government have been rooted in science," Weld said. "We need a change in policy from an approach that punishes the responsible use of marijuana and punishes harm reduction through policy innovation aimed at reducing the negative effects of cannabis prohibition."  A recent poll commissioned by the Colorado Chamber of Commerce showed the voters of that state were in favor of legalizing marijuana for recreational use rather than recreational sales.
Weld	William Floyd Weld (born July 31, 1945) is an American attorney, businessman, and Republican politician who served as the 68th Governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997. Weld is running for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2020.	Wikipedia	Weld is first known for serving as the Chairman of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee from 1996 until 2001.[1] He was elected Lieutenant Governor (U.S. Senate) of Rhode Island, where he was the longest serving governor in state history. Before becoming Lieutenant Governor, Weld served as a lawyer and legislative director at a law firm in Providence. He previously worked as a lawyer for former President George W. Bush.[2] Weld was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and the State Legislature from Rhode Island in 1972 and served for 25 consecutive years (1982-2004).  Throughout his career, Weld has served as a United States Senator, a state senator, member of the New England Law Review, and as a member of the General Assembly (the New England Legislature, which has direct authority to enact the state constitution.) Weld is a longtime social conservative, but has generally supported gay rights and LGBT civil rights issues throughout his political life.  A senior fellow at the Washington Examiner, Weld was formerly a member of the Executive Committee of Common Cause Rhode Island,[3] and wrote extensively about law, medicine, and international politics.

Weld	President Trump's 2020 campaign made it clear on Tuesday that it wasn't worried about a primary challenge by the former governor of Massachusetts, Bill Weld.	FoxNews	In an email sent out to reporters, campaign manager Zac Moffatt assured them that the Massachusetts Republican could run in 2020 after he secured enough signatures to make the November ballot. The email states: "The campaign will continue, as always, to work closely with state officials and the Trump administration."  The email, apparently intended for journalists, didn't sit well with some observers.  "It is a bit concerning that a campaign would attempt to stave off primary challengers by going all in with something of this magnitude," Eric O'Keefe, a political science professor and professor at James Madison University, told the Independent Record.  "When campaign finance laws are so flexible that it is legal for a foreign candidate to solicit foreign donations, when that candidate can raise millions, the president and his team can afford to raise more money," O'Keefe said in an interview Wednesday after the emails were first reported by The Huffington Post.  The campaign was not immediately available for comment. But Moffatt responded to The Associated Press earlier this year when asked why Weld was on the campaign's short list of possible presidential candidates.  The Weld campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment by email Wednesday.  Trump's allies in Massachusetts had

"So my message to a lot of Americans in Congress today, to make sure they get their paychecks, but that if they don't pay their bills, this is an important lesson if this should happen."   If the president gets his way, lawmakers won't have to pay anything to get it done.   Warren said she doesn't think any of her fellow Democrats are willing pay a price for the president's agenda though.   Her colleague, Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), had this to say about Warren's comments   "I think our job is to work with anyone who is able to come together, but our job is not to pay them to stop or stand up for something they're not passionate about," Murray said.   This interview comes as Senator Bernie Sanders has said Warren was right.   She is absolutely right, so why is she not doing the same thing on the Trump train?   Bernie Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night, "We know what he is. He is a racist, sexist, homophobic maniac!"   If Warren had told us that she wasn't interested in getting involved

A year earlier, Obama appointed Warren to his Supreme Court nomination team. They were engaged from early 2015 on. They have both criticized Obama's presidency.  Obama and Clinton meet in 2015 at White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest's first event as Press Secretary.  Warren's husband, former Massachusetts Governor Bill, played an important role in Hillary Clinton's 2008 Presidential campaign. He helped her raise funds through Bill's firm, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Warren also gave to Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.  During the presidential campaign, Obama had to address a group of white evangelical men who opposed his plans to increase defense spending.

Elizabeth Warren said she will go on Wednesday to a facility in Homestead, Florida, that's holding unaccompanied migrant children -- a suddenly announced visit amid a fight on Capitol Hill over funding for the program that cares for such children and controversy over conditions at some border facilities.	CNN	"It is our hope that at the end of this session the debate will not last very long," said Warren of the House hearing on a bill aimed at defunding the program.  She hopes to make the case that House leadership is not using it "to ram through a partisan policy that would hurt families."  At the same hearing, the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat called for lawmakers to vote on an amendment to overhaul the immigration system, known as the Secure Communities bill, that would have created a pathway for the families to come into the country.  But Republican Rep. Don Young of Alabama had concerns about the amendment that would make "comfortable claims about what immigration systems will look like without border security, without any real border security." Young asked for clarification on whether that means any funding for sanctuary municipalities would come from an appropriation for the Department of Homeland Security.  Young also warned lawmakers it is wrong to blame the parents of the children for the problems the immigrant children are facing at the border.  "You have the parents of one child -- two children, one is from Haiti,
Warren	Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is the latest 2020 Democrat to be in favor of decriminalizing border crossing as the field of candidates continue to move left on immigration.	FoxNews	Her position aligns with that of Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who would open up the legal pathway to citizenship for all illegal immigrants in the country. Warren's support for ending President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which makes it easier for young illegal immigrants who were brought here illegally as minors to stay in the U.S., was widely applauded last week.  Warren's position is in keeping with President Trump's calls to "make childhood illegal." His top adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested during an interview with "Face The Nation" the president intends to put the issue on the president's agenda when next year's convention convenes.  "I think President Trump believes that President Eisenhower's idea of putting an end to the 'war on drugs' has failed and it's time for all Americans to put an end to that," Conway said.  Clinton also pushed for the legalization of illegal aliens last year but she never had serious discussions about using criminal prosecutions to help them come and go as citizens. She did say once it became clear she would be a 2016 presidential candidate, she would push for legal status for those who were already citizens through a pathway to citizenship, an attempt
